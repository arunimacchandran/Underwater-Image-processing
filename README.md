# Underwater-Image-processing

Underwater imaging is an emerging area of research.  The underwater image suffers degra-dation due to scattering and absorption.  To overcome these issues,  introduced a single imageapproach that does not require specialized hardware or knowledge about the underwater condi-tions or scene structure.  It builds on the blending of two images that are directly derived from acolor- compensated and white-balanced version of the original degraded image.  The two imagesto fusion, as well as their associated weight maps, are defined to promote the transfer of edges andcolor contrast to the output image.  To avoid that the sharp weight map transitions create arti-facts in the low frequency components of the reconstructed image, also adapt a multi-scale fusionstrategy.  Images enhanced using this method are characterized by better exposedness of the darkregions, improved global contrast, and edges sharpness.The algorithm is reasonably independentof the camera settings, and improves the accuracy of several image processing applications, suchas image segmentation and keypoint matching.
